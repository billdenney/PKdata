# PKdata

Pharmacokinetic data for testing software with real and statically
simulated data.  The target is that this package will cover different
relevant types of data with multiple examples of each type of data.

Current examples include:

* Hydrocortisone simulated data sets illustrating oral dosing.
* CP1805 data illustrating multiple routes of dosing with the same
  compound.
* TC20160506 (not the real drug name) real data illustrating multiple
  doses occurring in quick succession.
* KI20160914 (not the real drug name) adjusted data illustrating single
  dosing.
* Lipoic acid single-dose real data concentration over time and its
  NCA parameters as calculated by Kinetica and WinNonlin.
* Xanthohumol and its metabolite isoxanthohumol single-dose real data
  with complex increases and decreases in concentration over time and
  their NCA parameters as calculated by Kinetica and WinNonlin.
